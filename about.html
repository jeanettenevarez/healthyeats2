		<p>It's always been a tough journey to enjoy food with so many restrictions. 
		Coming from a family that enforces the "eat everything on your plate" rule, 
		it becomes especially hard to set new rules after so many years of being accustomed.</p> 
		<p>I recently started to follow a low-carb lifestyle. I won't be using the word "diet" 
		since it holds negative connotations. By following this lifestyle, my goal is not necessarily trying to lose weight.
		That's not the point. For me, it is to lead a healthier life for my current and future self.
		I did not wake up one day and say that I was going to follow a low-carb diet. It was after succumbing to COVID-19 in 2020, 
		that I was diagnosed with diabetes. I cannot say for sure if the virus had any part of my new-found illness,
		but it was at that time that my life had changed.</p>
		<p>I was put in a low-carb "diet" by my doctor to help control my sugar levels. I was (I still am) a foodie. 
		In my head, that was the end of the world. What can I possibly eat now? How can I stop eating all the delicious, fatty, sugary, savory foods around me?  
		I was downgraded from a feast to basically nothing!</p>
		<p>Or so I thought.</p>
		<p>What is a journey without struggles? It was not easy to start this journey. It was not easy to maintain it either. 
		Initially, I was given a list of foods that I was able to consume and the serving sizes. It started off alright, but it was not fun. 
		I ended up retaliating and started eating how I normally would have been eating. Now that I look back, who was I fighting with? The doctor? The world? 
		I was fighting myself.</p>
		<p>I realized that I was not making it easy for myself to transition to this new and abrupt change. It cannot and should not happen from one morning to the next.
		I needed to make plans and reorganize my priorities. I went on YouTube and started binging on all the videos pertaining to low-carb and keto "diets". 
		I went on Amazon and started buying cookbooks. Little by little I changed what and I was consuming. And little by little it I realized that it became easier.</p>
		<p>And after two long years, for me, here I am ready to give the little knowledge I have collected (recipes) and hopefully make someones life a little easier. 
		And tastier!</p>
		<p>HealthyEats is a place where I will share my love of food with you. We will be healthy foodies together.</p>
